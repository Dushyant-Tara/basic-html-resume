    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>As a solutions engineer at an adtech company in Sydney, I leverage my expertise in data science and machine learning to provide effective solutions to clients. With a previous position as a data scientist at Walmart, I developed an eye for detail in managing and analyzing large datasets. Prior to that, I was a key member of the R&D team at MiQ Digital, where I played an instrumental role in creating machine learning solutions tailored to the advertising industry.

        My experience working with data and developing machine learning models has provided me with a unique perspective in my current role. I enjoy collaborating with clients to identify their needs and provide solutions that are both innovative and effective. I take pride in being able to effectively communicate complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, helping them understand the value and impact of our solutions.
        
        Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, and project management. I am dedicated to continuously expanding my knowledge and staying up-to-date on the latest technologies and techniques in my field. When I'm not working, I enjoy exploring the outdoors and volunteering with organizations that are committed to making a positive impact in the community.</p>
